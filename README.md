# Python Contact Book

A simple contact book made using PySimpleGui.

Saves all contacts through a json file stored in the root folder, as well as some stats and (maybe in the future)
actual configuration values.

## Running
Install by either cloning the repo through git, or downloading the zip directly(Big Green Code Button -> Download Zip.) 

If you're on **Windows**, run **py_contact_book.bat**, found in the root folder.

If you're on **Linux** or **Mac**, run **py_contact_book.sh**, also found in the root folder.

These files will install PySimpleGui and run the program.

You can also run the program from the command-line. 
This is probably faster if you have the requirements already installed.

## Updating
If I ever make a substantial update to this you would like to "upgrade" to, here are the steps to update the program.

### Using Git (Recommended if you know how)
Simply open the root folder in the terminal, and run `git pull`. 
This will update the program while keeping your contacts, configuration, and stats intact.

### Redownloading
Back up your `saved_contacts.json` and `config.ini` files somewhere else on your computer before repeating the steps you 
followed to download this from GitHub originally (Big Green Code Button -> Download Zip).
